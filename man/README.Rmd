The goal of smouseGPS is to smooth and interpolate noisy GPS data. It enables to
deal with outliers by indentifying them thanks to a collection of b-splines. 
This package is based on the work of Jeffrey J. Early and Adam M. Sykulski
(https://jeffreyearly.com/smoothing-and-interpolating-noisy-gps-data/).
It is a translation from Matlab language to R language. The documentation is
on my github page [alexmerot.github.io/smouseGPS/](https://alexmerot.github.io/smouseGPS/).

## Installation
